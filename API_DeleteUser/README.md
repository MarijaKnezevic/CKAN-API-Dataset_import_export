# Soft-Delete CKAN Users Script and Export CKAN Users to Excel Script

The Python script is designed to soft-delete (deactivate) users in a CKAN instance by setting their state to deleted. The script fetches all users from the CKAN instance, identifies the target users by their usernames, and updates their state to deleted.
